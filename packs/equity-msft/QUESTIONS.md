# thinkingtext/equity-msft 0.1.0: the questions

Every question is the article followed by one sentence that stops where a one-word answer goes, written here as `___`. The engine
reads the two answers' log-probabilities at that point; the read is `logprob(first) − logprob(second)`, and the sign is the
direction of the first answer toward the category's "up" (a higher oil price, a higher share price). The questions are listed by
category, in the order the pack averages them.
